# Idea and animations: 
This is a game I take the inspiration from Fake MG, a Youtuber who's also a UET student. I watched his video and was impressed by the idea, so I decided to make this game, with almost similar gameplay :).

The main character of this game is a corgi. I chose corgi because it's cute. I found a cute corgi's animations sprite on itch.io, I "took inspiration" from it and redrawn all the corgi's animations by myself.

I also "took inspiration" from a free map tileset on itch.io and redrawn it.

# Game Play and Control
Use [a] or right arrow to move corgi to the right.

Use [d] or right arrow to move corgi to the left.

Use [w] or right arrow to make corgi jump.

The gameplay is quite simple. You use the above directional keys to control a corgi. If the corgi is fall out of the map, or is striked by lightning, you lose.

Thanks for spending timme reading this and I hope you enjoy the game.
