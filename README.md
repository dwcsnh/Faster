# Faster!
# Idea and animations: 
This is a game I take the inspiration from Fake MG, a Youtuber who's also a UET student. I watched his video and was impressed by the idea, so I decided to make this game, with almost similar gameplay :).

The main character of this game is a corgi. I chose corgi because it's cute. I found a cute corgi's animations sprite on itch.io, I "took inspiration" from it and redrawn all the corgi's animations by myself.

I also "took inspiration" from a free map tileset on itch.io and redrawn it.

# Game Play

In this game, you are a corgi trying to run away from the lightning. You should keep the corgi survive as long as possible.

If the corgi is struck by lightning, or falls out of the map, you lose.
